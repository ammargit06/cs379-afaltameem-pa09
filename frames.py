PA 6: The Activation Record -- starter.

Complete ActivationRecord and CallStack below. See
PA_06_The_Activation_Record.md, Part B, for the full requirements.

Note on scope: PA1-5 never added function-call SYNTAX to USILang's
grammar (deliberately -- see PA5's pipeline-context note). PA6's
Part B interface is pure Python classes with no mention of parser
changes either, so test_frames.py drives ActivationRecord/CallStack
directly in Python (simulating what a parsed function call sequence
would do) rather than parsing real USILang function syntax. Your job
this week is the frame model itself, not a grammar extension.
